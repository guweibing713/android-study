This project is about SlidingMenu Learning.

when i download the SlidingMenu-master.zip and i unzip it to the desktop,

and i import the project into Eclipse, when I new a Project "MySlidingMenu" and add the libary into my Project as lib, but when i debug it always Export the Error like "Coundn't find class 'com.jeremyfeinstein.slidingmenu.lib.SlidingMenu'.

At last, I think maybe i unzip the SlidingMenu project into a wrong address that include Chinese as "×ÀÃæ", so I just copy them into my workspace and the Error never come agagin.
